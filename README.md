This is just a basic foundation refresher to fill in any gaps in my knowledge. This is a technique that I use to make me become a better developer. An anology I would use is when you paint something. You give that item multiple coats to achieve a more solid color and to increase integrity. With knowledge, it helps to apply more coatings to better solidify the knowledge and overall foundation.
